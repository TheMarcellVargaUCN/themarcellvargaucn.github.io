                            <p>CatchScan is an IT company, whose mission is to help content creators to protect their brand and place them in control of their content. Their product is a software driven platform where content creators can establish an automated protection regarding to their copyright. They offer a web app, where influencers or other artists can insert their intellectual work (for now only images) and make sure that no one else is using it without their permission. As the creator upload their work, the algorithm can search for any misconduct.

                                <br>
                                Our client gave us the task to come up with a user-friendly interface and reestablish the architecture of their app while utilizing their already existing in-house algorithm.

                                <p>Our client had created a beta version of their product, where their main focus was on the functionality itself, rather than the user experience. This led to broken user flows of the existing dashboard, resulting in an unpleasing, confusing experience, which doesn’t represent the company’s values.

                                <p>The goal of this project is to create a web app for CatchScan, which will be utilizing their copyright matching algorithm. We need to create a visual interface with a well-developed and optimized structure, which will focus on information architecture and user navigation. The dashboard interface will be created from scratch and will help the user to find the functions with ease and fulfill their needs.</p>

                            <p>At the beginning of the whole process, we need to establish what kind of development method we are going to use. In this project we will be using Design Thinking development. Since it is a human-centered methodology, we bring the users to the spotlight and try to understand their problems, wants, needs, values, feelings. As we will know more about our users, we might re-frame our problem in order to achieve the best solution for them.

                            <p>First, we had set a subjective criteria where are we considered our user base based on their behaviors and psychographics. After this we also established an objective criteria which consisted of, they are geographic and the demographic status.</p>

                            <p>Based on our results, we assume our target audience is English speaker content creators between the age of 18-35.</p>

                            <p>To enhance our research further, we believe we can benefit from creating Personas.

                            <p>As a result of our inspiring brainstorming session, ended up with ideas based on both the user research results and the human-centered formulations.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>One of the most important result was proceeding with the dashboard styled design as we believed it could incorporate the most tools and usability.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Moreover, to accomplish this we stumbled upon applying elements of glassmorphism to help emphasize on the objects.</p>

                            <p>Our goal was to establish the information architecture in a way to make sure that the users can get their tasks done by spending the least amount of effort as possible, resulting in a satisfying, pleasant experience. This was carried out by provide the user with a clear and assorted information, which is being accompanied by well-defined suitable font type, size and color.</p>

                            <p>To become more precise and see the actual details, although not fully acquired yet, we have created low-fidelity wireframes, where we were focusing on the layout and identifying elements.</p>

                            <p>Considering the results of the user research we chose to apply a desktop first approach. This is because based on the user's preferences this is a more corporate pensive way of presenting the users with features.

                            <p>Having done with wireframes, guided us towards creating high-fidelity mockups.</p>

                            <p>Before we started the actual process of designing, we had decided on using Atomic Design as our choice of team collaboration methodology</p>

                            <p>As the atomic design consists of components, our design process started with the smallest ones - Atoms</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <p>By combining atoms together, we formed molecules. In our case as a molecules, we can consider buttons in navigation formed with an icon and text and cards with the buttons, texts, and images</p>

                            <p>Organisms are next phase of connection smaller elements. Putting together cards we create “libraries”, menu buttons - navigation</p>

                            <p>The first that draws the attention of the user are colors. They make the first impression, they affect how the users perceive the interface, see the functionality, they might evoke emotions, they increase the brand recognition as well, and invite the users to take an action. We are preparing solution for CatchScan, start-up company, with an already existing branding, thus we have decided to keep with their image and use their brand colors - blue and orange</p>

                            <p>Even though, this was not the requirement, we believe to keep the consistency with their promoting website is a good brand move</p>
