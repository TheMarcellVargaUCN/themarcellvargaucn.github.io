                            <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of workplaces has changed. More and more companies are in the process of transition from static to hybrid office environments. With this transition a new problem arises. Office resource management tools are simply not suitable for the new era of hybrid transformation.

                      <p>Based on the interviews, we gained insight to many unique needs, which we sorted and evaluated. From this we concluded that companies are looking to optimize their capacity of space resources and to increase the productivity of their employees by automating everyday ad-hoc tasks. In addition, complying with the hybrid model was a key factor.</p>

                        <p>We choose our card sorting method to be hybrid, as our end-product was focusing more on functionality, rather than pure information presentation.</p>

                        <p>We started to establish an informational architecture by creating a sitemap. Visual sitemaps gave us a clear representation of the structure for our product.

                        <p>Our discovery was dictated by two factors, which were our project needs and the technical requirements, including the potential limitations.</p>

                       <p>This time we started to apply more details, including a well-defined information architecture.</p>

                       <br>
                       <p>Based on the assessment of the card sorting we had re-evaluated and placed the access to the most important pages into the header, ending up with five subpages.</p>

                       <p>Our design was determined by the Fluent UI design system while retaining the AskCody corporate visual identity.</p>
                       <br>
                       <p>We made a dashboard design, including a snippet of a calendar for a quick overview of the upcoming events, which is one of the most crucial assets of an office worker. In case the visitor in the project manager, we also placed a quick overview widget for the tickets submitted though the support.</p>

                       <p>We have created design assets and components respecting the Microsoft design language, Fluent, due to our platform of implementation.</p>

                       <p>In terms of colors, we had to take both Teams' and AskCody's into consideration. It was important to establish a harmony between them, while not blending them in too much.</p>

                       <p>Despite them being a way to interpret the brand itself, it also helps capturing feeling, which we want to make the users feel when they are using our solution. Using it properly can improve how the users perceive and interact with the interface. AskCody's main color is a shade of blue, which is notoriously stand for calmness or serenity. This exactly captures what our goal is with our product by contributing to the establishment of a structured and orderly environment.</p>

                       <p>At this point, we had planned out how the interactions should behave and what they should result in, including changes based on additional feedback. </p>

                       <p>When thinking about convenience and fast ways of booking the resources, the mobile comes as an obvious solution, unless the ad-hoc on-site version is more convenient. This is exactly the reason we have decided to create a concept of what mobile interaction could look like.</p>
