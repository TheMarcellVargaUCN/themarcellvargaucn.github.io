                        <p>European Study Solution is a new start-up organization registered in Ukraine, whose purpose is to help American students with the application process and preparation for life abroad.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            ESS would like to provide a payable service for Americans to help with application submission to European educational programs. The companyâ€™s main service feature is a unique approach to their client, where the main focus would lay on helping to find professional orientation, assistance with all the documentary work, preparation for life abroad, etc.</p>

                    <div class="casebodytext">

                        <p>The main issue ESS is facing is that the company is missing an informative website with the necessary information, which would help students to choose them as a study agency. The website should contain all necessary information about available university programs, the application process, coming deadlines, service fees, and information about living abroad to make the website more attractive and useful to convince people to use the agency's service.

                        <p>This must be achieved by creating the website from scratch, which would be the main information platform for the company, where they could have an overview of different services, prices, and information about universities available in France.</p>

                    <div class="casebodytext">

                        <p>To ensure a flawless workflow, we've decided to create our project plan by using a Work Breakdown Structure both for the project and the report to improve our efficiency in terms of dividing tasks and their possible dependencies.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            By utilizing the Gantt chart, we will have the opportunity to visualize different tasks better, therefore we will have more seamless communication about our progress and challenges with the client.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As the organization does not have any background or website yet, it can be difficult to reach an ideal solution for the problem in a short period. We believe it will require many design iterations and user tests, and because it's very focused on user-centered design, where the user and the client are very much included in the process, will require us to do as many changes as the client wants.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With the five planes of UX, which is not purely plan-driven and has agile features, we feel more comfortable using, since we would have a fixed framework, which will help us to keep the focus better on the problem and do as many iterations as we can. That would be the main reason why we chose to work with five planes of UX.</p>

                        <p>To observe our target group approach and create a website, which the user will use, can be a tough task because people's approaches and needs are different. To know our users better, we would research them, which involves understanding the environment they live in and observing their behavior and habits they might have to form the direction of a website.
                            <br>
                            <br>    
                            Our data gathering started with qualitative user research. We have used this method because it gives a unique depth of understanding which is difficult to gain from a closed question survey. Respondents can freely disclose their experiences, thoughts, and feelings without constraint, which generates valuable conversation around the subject. 
                            <br>

                            Before meeting an interviewer, we created an interview guide with a categorization list, to set our target audience. We assume that our potential customers are American students from 18-25 years or older, who are willing to study abroad and are open to new cultures and experiences.

                        <p>To gain even more insight into conducted research, we have decided to create Personas. It helped us to understand usersâ€™ needs, to assume their experiences within a product, behavior, and goals.

                            The first Persona is Sophie, a twenty-year-old American student from Colorado, who just finished high school and is looking for some universities out of America to study Digital Marketing. Since education is too expensive for her in the USA, to live and study abroad it's not so cheap for her as well. She had a side job, where she was saving some money.
                            <img src="assets/images/ESS-Images/Picture 4.png">
                            The second Persona is Thomas Grey, who just finished middle school and is considering choosing a study program outside America. Since he can find fashion and design programs just in a few cities in the USA in which he is not much interested, he was looking more into the depth of the programs abroad and found many of them in Europe. Since one of his frustrations is to fail by filling the application and visa documentation, he might use the agency's help as well. Also, because he is open-minded, he already has some friends who live there, so they could be a big motivation for him to go abroad.

            <br>
            <br>
            We started with setting two key issues: what value should the website bring for the organization and what value it can bring for the user. Since the agency doesn't have any website yet, it would be a core platform for them to attract potential customers, and for the users, it would be the main moderator between the agency and partner universities.
            <br>
            <br>
            By answering these questions, it helped us to see that the website we will produce, will be more intended to use as an information website, with less functional specifications and more content requirements, so we will spend more time on Information Architecture, to increase the content readability.
            <img src="assets/images/ESS-Images/FivePlane4.png">
            <span id="highlight">Scope Plane</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            At this phase, we define what content elements may be required to meet users' needs. We didn't seem to know a lot about the user, just from the categorization, we assumed user gender, age, and behavior features, so it can be difficult to set the main goal of the product and what user problems we should help to solve. That is why we have made qualitative research- interviews on our target group to make a valuable product, which would meet their needs.
            <br>
            <br>
            From the functional side, features like a navigation bar, which should display the clear website structure, and contact form would matter the most, since the agency at first receives applications and then have meetings with applicants.
            <br>
            <br>
            From the content requirements side, it should have a clear information structure for the user, using information hierarchy and prioritizing the most important information, also visuals-like pictures and video reviews section and description of what is included in different price packages, reviews, FAQ
            <img src="assets/images/ESS-Images/FivePlane3.png">
            <span id="highlight">Structure Plane</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            After the requirements have been set, we have a clear picture of what will be included on the website. After a few more meetings with a client, we have added new elements like FAQ and a scale of American and European Study tuition price, which she thinks will help to visualize the difference even more.
            <br>
            <br>
            In content development, structuring the user experience is a question of information architecture, creating categories and navigational schemes that allow users to move through the site content effectively. So, this phase is all about understanding the user, even more, the way they behave and think.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            By building this understanding into the structure of our website, will help us to ensure a successful experience for those who will use it.

            <span id="highlight">Skeleton Plane</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            in this phase, we have already experimented with the very first wireframe, identifying specific aspects of the interface like navigation, placing the buttons, blocks of text, etc. On the structure plane, we looked at the larger-scale issues of architecture and interactions. In this phase, our concerns exist at a smaller scale of individual components and their relationship.

                        <p>The structure of the website is defined by Information Architecture, which gives a website a competitive advantage. Users mostly want to perform their tasks with the least amount of effort possible and will choose to use the product that creates the easiest, and most pleasant experience for them. It gives the user an experience with a product that feels natural, so they can focus on the task theyâ€™re trying to accomplish instead of figuring out how to use the product.

                            <br>
                            One of the most important purposes of websites is to interpret information for the users. To truly accomplish this task, we need to define the most relevant content for the user.

                        <p>At the skeleton phase, we have created the first design iterations- wireframes. It helped us to see a clear overview of the page structure, layout, information architecture, and intended user behaviors. As a wireframe usually represents the initial product concept, styling, color, and graphics we kept it to a minimum. We have used a digital way of displaying it, using Adobe XD, since we believe it's easier to visualize than using a paper version.  According to the landing page, we had a few iterations of displaying elements. In the navigation bar, we displayed different page labels- Available Programs, Service, Contact, and Apply page, to show the website structure, and would make it to be sticky and follow when scrolling down, to let the user navigate more easily to other pages. After some discussions, we decided to marge contact and apply pages because they would contain very similar information, which would create some confusion for the user on which one to use.
                            <img src="assets/images/ESS-Images/Picture 5.png">
                            Besides, at the very beginning of the website, we had a similar vision of displaying a full-width picture or slide show gallery.
                            Since the landing page is the most important one, which should create the user's interest from the very first second, using the hierarchy of information, allows to point out to the viewer what he wants to see first. This is highly important as users tend not to spend too much time on the website these days. According to our prototypes, we wanted to mention what ESS is about and what service they can provide, also the key points, and the application process step-by-step. We came up with different iterations for that.</p>

We tried to group them, by using The Principle of Objects according to the 8 Principles of Information Architecture, where we grouped similar content as well as determining each groupâ€™s attributes. Pressing one of the links will lead the user to the place, where the precise content is displayed.</p>

Should it be as a sidebar or navigation bar on the top of the page? The most convenient solution we came up, was to have a vertical sidebar on the side, with different tabs, and on the right, a block of the container with the information, which will change according to the tab.</p>

                            <p>On the university page, the important role has the content and visuals. It was our task to make it informative and information easily readable.  Since we have different universities' information, we tried to make the layout template that should suit all of them. In this phase, we still don't know how to place five different universities on the page and toggle information between them. According to the Program Degrees, using the Principle of Disclosure, we displayed different tabs of education degrees, rather than having it as a blank of content.

On the landing page, we displayed it as inline elements and thought about having a hover effect pop out when they press on one of them. On the university page, we thought about using the same method and displaying it in the horizontal line with university icons, which by clicking, will change the content.</p>

                        <p>Moreover, the price scale, which would show the difference between the American and European university tuition prices, will help to highlight the difference between it, and convince the user to consider the possibility to use the agency help and study abroad.</p>

Here, the content, functionality, and aesthetics come together to produce a finished design that pleases the user's needs.  At the Surface plane, we are dealing with the High-fidelity mock-ups and user tests, where we determine how that arrangement of elements should be presented visually.</p>

                        <p>Unlike the low-fidelity prototype, mock-ups are highly functional and interactive.

                            As you can see, we are using many vector graphics around the website, because using SVG format, they are very easily scalable, intuitive, and are easy to manipulate when changing colors or deleting unnecessary elements around them, and the most important is that they don't lose the quality.
                            <br>
                            In the review section, we have displayed only three comments, because the agency just started their business, but so in the future, when they will have more of them, we would use an automatic slide function or arrows. According to the service package, we wanted to display it in different colors, to help to distinguish different packages better. Often a vivid-colored background or text helps to highlight the information so it can be easily found.

                            When you look at six paragraphs of text with no pictures, what are the chances youâ€™ll sit down to read it?  Pictures can instantly change the mood and leave impressions much faster and much more accurately than words can. Thatâ€™s why we implemented an automatic gallery slideshow on the main page, and a picture gallery under each university and service description page.

                            On the contact us page, when the user fills the form and presses the button send, nothing happens or appears on the website, which should tell the user, that his/her answer was submitted. In this way, it gives some uncertainty, and the website might look not very reliable. That's why we came up with the idea of having a separated window, which pops out after submitting an application, which would tell the user what he needs to do next, in this case, wait for an agency to contact him back.

                        <p>Testing a new product is one of the most crucial processes in determining whether the product is working as expected and if there is anything not working as the ideal that we are unaware of! When we create a product, we normally do it for a certain target audience, and we need to conduct tests to check if that same target audience receives and processes all the information as we had imagined.

Having stated that, we decided to take 2 tests: a 5-second test that allows us to view and absorb the information that the user sees, and processes based on their first impression and a Think Aloud test where we could test practically if the user could find all the information that he needed easily and if he can understand the purpose of the website.

Also, the proper images and information, as well as deciding on the website's design and functionality. We were able to improve the content organization, readability, and navigation system by developing an information hierarchy. We were able to make the website visually appealing by implementing design principles such as Gestalt, Atomic Design, and User-Cantered Design.
