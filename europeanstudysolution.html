                        <p>European Study Solution is a new start-up organization registered in Ukraine, whose purpose is to help American students with the application process and preparation for life abroad.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            ESS would like to provide a payable service for Americans to help with application submission to European educational programs. The company’s main service feature is a unique approach to their client, where the main focus would lay on helping to find professional orientation, assistance with all the documentary work, preparation for life abroad, etc.</p>

                            <p>The main issue ESS is facing is that the company is missing an informative website with the necessary information, which would help students to choose them as a study agency. The website should contain all necessary information about available university programs, the application process, coming deadlines, service fees, and information about living abroad to make the website more attractive and useful to convince people to use the agency's service.

                            <p>This must be achieved by creating the website from scratch, which would be the main information platform for the company, where they could have an overview of different services, prices, and information about universities available in France.</p>

                        <p>To get a better understanding of our users we had to conduct detailed research understand the environment they live in and observe their behaviors and habits

                        <br>    
                        We proceeded with gathering data using qualitative user research where we conducted interviews using a closed question survey. For this we have created an interview guide with a categorization list, to set our target audience which in our case consisted of American students from 18-20 year-old or older, willing to study abroad and open to new cultures and experiences</p>

            <span id="highlight">Strategy plane</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>We started with setting two key issues: what value should the website bring for the organization and what value it can bring for the user. Since the agency didn't have any website yet, it would be a core platform for them to attract potential customers, and for the users, it would be the main moderator between the agency and partner universities.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>By answering these questions, it helped us to see that the website we will produce, will be more intended to use as an information website, with less functional specifications and more content requirements, hence spending more time on Information Architecture, to increase the content readability</p>
            <img src="assets/images/ESS-Images/FivePlane4.png">
            <span id="highlight">Scope Plane</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>We defined what are the required content elements to meet the users' needs, both from the functional and content requirement side.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/ESS-Images/FivePlane3.png">
            <span id="highlight">Structure Plane</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>After the requirements have been set, we got a clear picture of what will be included on the website. Besides adding new elements after meeting with our client, we revised the information architecture and created categories and navigational schemes that would allow users to move through the site content efficiently.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In this phase, we have already experimented with the very first wireframe, identifying specific aspects of the interface like navigation, placing the buttons, blocks of text, etc. On the structure plane, we looked at the larger-scale issues of architecture and interactions. In this phase, our concerns exist at a smaller scale of individual components and their relationship.</p>

                        <p>The main purpose of our website was to interpret information for the users, by performing tasks with the least amount of effort possible contributing to an easy and natural experience.

                        <p>As part of the skeleton phase, we have created the first design iterations - Wireframes. It gave us clear overview of the page structure and while represented the initial product concept, we kept styling, color, and graphics to the minimum.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We established the navigation bar where we included different page labels to emphasize the structure.</p>

                            <p>Besides, at the very beginning of the website, we had a similar vision of displaying a full-width picture or slide show gallery.</p>

                            <p>Since the landing page is what will catch the user's interest from the very second, therefore we made multiple different prototype, where we clarified what ESS is about and what service they provide, including the key points of their service.</p>

                            <p>We considered implementing a section where the reviews of the company would be shown. Our idea was to display these as a card element in accordance with the Gestalt Principles.</p>

                            <p>Moving to the service page, the most convenient solution we came up with is a vertical sidebar on the left with variety of tabs. On the right side, we placed a container with information, which can be changed by using the tabs</p>
                            <img src="assets/images/ESS-Images/Picture 10.png">
                            <p>We placed a page for the universities, where content and visuals play an important role, therefore it was our task to make it informative, while being easily readable. Since we have different universities' information, we tried to make the layout template that should suit all of them.

                        <p>Following additional client meetings, we showcased the partner universities on the landing page based on feedback. This inspired us to display them on the university page as well, whereby clicking on the icon of the institution, the content will change accordingly.</p>

                        <p>As a follow-up, we also placed a price scale, to highlight the advantage of using the service of our client by studying in European universities over Americans.</p>
